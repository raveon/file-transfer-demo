Narrowband Radio File Transfer Demonstration using Raveon's WMX

This code example is provided to show how to use Raveon's advanced [WMX][http://www.raveon.com/wmx.html] protocol to communicate over-the-air using narrowband radios. WMX provides a high level of control over data transmission not normally available in radio modems. 

This example shows not only how to send a receive data, but how to use the status responses from the modem to perform advanced flow control. It is not intended to be used as-is, but the WMX message creation and parsing classes provided can be used directly in integrations using WMX-enabled modems. Raveon uses these same WMX classes in its own offerings.
